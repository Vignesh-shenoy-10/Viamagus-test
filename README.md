Technologies/Libraies used:
1. ReactJs - My Favorite JS Library
2. Material UI - To use ready made components and save time!
3. Axios - To integrate REST API's
4. sass - To use scss for animations
5. React-paginate - To create a paginator component
6. React-router-dom - For routing within the app
7. Git/Github - To store the code
8. Netlify - To host the application

I have tried to follow the best development practices when it comes to maintaining clean and readble code. I have tried to use animation in one of the pages. I have not used Redux since i felt it wasnt a requirement considering the complexity of this application.
